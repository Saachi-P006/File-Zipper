# 📦 File-Zipper

File-Zipper is a simple and interactive web-based tool that allows users to upload multiple files and compress them into a single ZIP file.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean card-style UI with smooth animations for an intuitive experience.

🚀 Core highlight:
Behind the scenes, File-Zipper implements a Huffman Coding–based compression algorithm, demonstrating concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) such as trees, priority queues, and bit manipulation.
This makes it not just a web app, but also a practical application of algorithmic optimization and efficient data encoding.
